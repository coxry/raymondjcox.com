    <p>Welcome to my website! I'm a software engineer who loves writing code. I work full time for <a href="https://www.petpocketbook.com">PetPocketbook</a>, I also do some consulting work on the side. </p>
    <p>Here is my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raymond-cox-4a561342">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="/resume.pdf">Resume</a> in case you're interested in contacting me. I primarily do Ruby (Ruby on Rails) and Javscript (Ember.js) but I am open to any opportunity!</p>
    <p>Other than software engineering, I bike, hike, and do a bit of photography!</p>
